mail_sorter allows you to sort emails by tags and then send them to associated companies. This version of MailSorter has the ability to save its condition, so every time the page is reloaded, all data will remain. 
there is also a light version of MailSorter on the no_state_version branch.

how to use:         showcase - https://youtu.be/pii2z44lezY         demo - https://zaxel.github.io/mail_sorter/
1. start by adding a new company where you plan to send your emails by filling out the create form at the bottom of the page.
    1.1 you must enter the company name and a valid company email in the appropriate create company form field.
    1.2 you can also add your email text while adding a new company (you will be able to edit it later anytime you like).
    1.3 you can also add tags. Tags can be added in bulk; just specify them separated by a comma. For example: dog, cat, mouse. (You will be able to edit, add, or remove tags later anytime you like).
2. you can change any data on created company anytime.
3. you can add or remove any tag on any company anytime you like.
4. once you have all your company and tags ready, you can start sorting your text. Just enter your text in the textarea at the top of the page and press the "find" button. the website will check the entered text and compare it with all tags entered in companies. if the entered text contains the text of some of the tags, the script will send it to the company associated with this tag. if the same text is found in tags of different companies, the text will be sent to every company. once the text is sent, you will be able to see it in the company card textarea. 
at the same time, it will be deleted from the search textarea at the top of the page.
5. once you have your text sorted by companies, you can check again if you're happy with the text. You can edit it if you need to.
6. once you are ready, press the "send" button on the company, and the text will be sent to the company email.
